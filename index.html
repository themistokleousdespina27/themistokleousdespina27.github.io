				<h4>🥩 What to Feed</h4>
					<p>High-quality dog food (dry kibble, wet food, or a mix)

					Look for real meat (chicken, lamb, fish) as the first ingredient

					Avoid foods with lots of fillers, artificial colors, or sugar</p>

					<h4>🕒 How Often to Feed</h4>

					<p>Puppy (under 1 year): 3 meals per day

					Adult: 2 meals per day (morning & evening)

					Senior: 2 smaller meals per day

					Cocker Spaniels love food and can gain weight easily, so regular meal times are important.</p>

					<h4>📏 How Much to Feed</h4>

					<p>This depends on weight, age, and activity level, but as a general guide:

					Adult Cocker Spaniel (12–14 kg / 26–31 lb):
					➜ about 1 to 1½ cups of dry food per day, split into 2 meals

					Always check the feeding guide on the food bag and adjust as needed.</p>

					<h4>🦴 Treats</h4>

					<p>Use treats sparingly

					Healthy options: small dog treats, carrot pieces, apple slices (no seeds)

					Treats should be no more than 10% of daily calories</p>

					<h4>🚫 Foods to Avoid</h4>

					<p>Never give:

					Chocolate

					Grapes or raisins

					Onions, garlic

					Cooked bones

					Salty or sugary human food</p>

					<h4>💧 Water</h4>

					<p>Fresh, clean water should be available at all times</p>

					<h4>❤️ Extra Tips for Cocker Spaniels</h4>

					<p>They’re prone to ear infections, so avoid very messy food around the ears

					Measure food—don’t free-feed

					If your dog scratches, has ear problems, or digestive issues, ask your vet about food sensitivities

					If you want, tell me:

					puppy or adult?</p>
